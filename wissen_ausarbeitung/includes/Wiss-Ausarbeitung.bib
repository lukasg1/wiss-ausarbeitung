  abstract = {Online end-user training offers the flexibility and cost efficiency of computer-based training and the individual attention and support of instructor-guided training. At the same time, it continuously empowers end users by providing them with more up-to-date knowledge and decision-making authority over their own training.}

  abstract = {Objective: We measured the long-term retention of knowledge gained through selected American Academy of Neurology annual meeting courses and compared the effects of repeated quizzing (known as test-enhanced learning) and repeated studying on that retention. Methods: Participants were recruited from 4 annual meeting courses. All participants took a pretest. This randomized, controlled trial utilized a within-subjects design in which each participant experienced 3 different postcourse activities with each activity performed on different material. Each key information point from the course was randomized in a counterbalanced fashion among participants to one of the 3 activities: repeated short-answer quizzing, repeated studying, and no further exposure to the materials. A final test covering all information points from the course was taken 5.5 months after the course. Results: Thirty-five participants across the 4 courses completed the study. Average score on the pretest was 36\%. Performance on the final test showed that repeated quizzing led to significantly greater long-term retention relative to both repeated studying (55\% vs 46\%; t[34] 5 3.28, SEM 5 0.03, p 5 0.01, d 5 0.49) and no further exposure (55\% vs 44\%; t[34] 5 3.16, SEM 5 0.03, p 5 0.01, d 5 0.58). Relative to the pretest baseline, repeated quizzing helped participants to retain almost twice as much of the knowledge acquired from the course compared to repeated studying or no further exposure. Conclusions: Whereas annual meeting continuing medical education (CME) courses lead to longterm gains in knowledge, when repeated quizzing is added, retention is significantly increased. CME planners may consider adding repeated quizzing to increase the impact of their courses. Neurology® 2015;84:748–754},

However, little is known about what factors should be considered in designing end-user training programs. This empirical study investigates the factors that are essential for successful end-user training. The study results indicate both the importance of end-user information system (IS) acceptance and the strong relationships among end-user IS acceptance, end-user IS satisfaction, and end-user job satisfaction.},

  abstract = {It has become increasingly necessary to motivate and actively involve users to provide quality feedback for the development of future versions of applications and services within whatever institution is at issue. For this purpose we have developed an E-Quiz game to accelerate the process of learning, understanding and the successful usage of new technologies and applications. The E-Quiz is based on a simple content management system where questions and answers can be defined, personal and organisational data can be stored and a rule system on performance scores can be executed. E-Quiz games are an integrated part within a new IT marketing strategy including internal eCommunity systems, which have evolved over the past few years in response to decreasing user acceptance caused by new applications and technologies. E-Quiz games are not limited to IT content and will be applied in the future to affirm general intra-organisational knowledge dissemination.},
