  abstract = {The problem and the solution. The workforce of the 21st century is in a continual state of flux. This has created a need by human resource development scholars and practitioners to continue to review best practices in developing a workforce with the latest technology, knowledge, and expertise. Revisiting traditional training models and processes is important as a means of moving forward. Although there are many system models, almost all are based on the generic analysis, design, develop, implement, and evaluate (ADDIE) model that evolved from instructional systems research following World War II. The purposes of this article are to (a) reacquaint the profession with the background and basic concepts of the traditional ADDIE model and (b) compare the original and revised ADDIE models. Subsequent articles in this volume deal with issues and advancements surrounding ADDIE and the ADDIE phases.},

In order to conceive and execute such courses, different teaching models can be chosen. In this work, we overview the theoretical foundations related to the techniques of development of courses mediated by technologies from the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation (ADDIE) model. We propose the extended ADDIE (X-ADDIE) for the elaboration of DL courses. In the proposed X-ADDIE, besides the execution step, a new step is added, defined as pilot experiment. All the X-ADDIE steps are tracked by a project management tool. We evaluate the proposed X-ADDIE model by means of a qualitative approach.},

  abstract = {E-learning presents an entirely new learning environment for students, thus requiring a different skill set to be successful. Critical thinking, research, and evaluation skills are growing in importance as students have increasing volumes of information from a variety of sources to sort through (New Media Consortium, 2007). In addition, particularly in courses that are electronic, students are much more independent than in the traditional setting. This requires that they be highly motivated and committed to learning, with less social interaction with peers or an instructor. Students in online courses tend to do as well as those in classrooms, but there is higher incidence of withdrawal or incomplete grades. E-learning can be viewed as computer assisted learning, and as pedagogy for student-centered and collaborative learning. Early developments in e-learning focused on computer assisted learning, where part or all of the learning content is delivered digitally. More recently, the pedagogical dimension of e-learning has become prominent. E-learning comprises all forms of electronically supported learning and teaching. The information and communication systems, whether networked learning or not, serve as specific media to implement the learning process.}

  abstract = {Objective: We measured the long-term retention of knowledge gained through selected American Academy of Neurology annual meeting courses and compared the effects of repeated quizzing (known as test-enhanced learning) and repeated studying on that retention. Methods: Participants were recruited from 4 annual meeting courses. All participants took a pretest. This randomized, controlled trial utilized a within-subjects design in which each participant experienced 3 different postcourse activities with each activity performed on different material. Each key information point from the course was randomized in a counterbalanced fashion among participants to one of the 3 activities: repeated short-answer quizzing, repeated studying, and no further exposure to the materials. A final test covering all information points from the course was taken 5.5 months after the course. Results: Thirty-five participants across the 4 courses completed the study. Average score on the pretest was 36\%. Performance on the final test showed that repeated quizzing led to significantly greater long-term retention relative to both repeated studying (55\% vs 46\%; t[34] 5 3.28, SEM 5 0.03, p 5 0.01, d 5 0.49) and no further exposure (55\% vs 44\%; t[34] 5 3.16, SEM 5 0.03, p 5 0.01, d 5 0.58). Relative to the pretest baseline, repeated quizzing helped participants to retain almost twice as much of the knowledge acquired from the course compared to repeated studying or no further exposure. Conclusions: Whereas annual meeting continuing medical education (CME) courses lead to longterm gains in knowledge, when repeated quizzing is added, retention is significantly increased. CME planners may consider adding repeated quizzing to increase the impact of their courses. Neurology® 2015;84:748–754},

Collaborative learning has been proven in promoting soft skills development. However, the feedback from employers is the opposite. It shows that collaboration does not happen naturally in a group. In previous studies, researchers have identified factors and elements needed to develop effective collaborative online learning and proposed an Online Collaborative Project based Collaborative Learning (OPBCL) model. In this study, based on OPBCL model, a prototype is designed using the ADDIE model. To carry out the study, the prototype needs to work properly. Therefore, Alpha, Beta, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) must be conducted. This study also will show the process of testing to ensure the functionality of a prototype when running the actual study. The results are expected to show that the prototype is ready to be tested in the actual study. It is hope that this study will give much significance to other researchers regarding the importance of conducting UAT of the prototypes developed prior to the research study.},

The opportunities of e-learning and the specific advantages of the software packet HotPotatoes and Audacity have been described. The advantages of the use of the presented multimedia products have been analyzed. INTRODUCTION E-learning stands for education via the Internet, network, or standalone computer. E -learning is essentially the network-enabled transfer of skills and knowledge. It refers to using electronic applications and processes to learn. These applications and processes include Web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual classrooms and digital collaboration. The content, to be studied, is delivered via the Internet, intranet/extranet, audio or video tape, satellite TV, and CD-ROM. The American Society for Training and Development defines e-learning as a broad set of applications and processes which include web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual classrooms, and digital contents. The definition of e-learning varies depending on the organization and how it is used, but basically it involves electronic means of communication, education, and training (1).}

  abstract = {Over the last century hundreds of studies have demonstrated that testing is an effective intervention to enhance long-term retention of studied knowledge and facilitate mastery of new information, compared with restudying and many other learning strategies (e.g., concept mapping), a phenomenon termed the testing effect. How robust is this effect in applied settings beyond the laboratory? The current review integrated 48,478 students’ data, extracted from 222 independent studies, to investigate the magnitude, boundary conditions, and psychological underpinnings of test-enhanced learning in the classroom. The results show that overall testing (quizzing) raises student academic achievement to a medium extent (g = 0.499). The magnitude of the effect is modulated by a variety of factors, including learning strategy in the control condition, test format consistency, material matching, provision of corrective feedback, number of test repetitions, test administration location and timepoint, treatment duration, and experimental design. The documented findings support 3 theories to account for the classroom testing effect: additional exposure, transfer-appropriate processing, and motivation. In addition to their implications for theory development, these results have practical significance for enhancing teaching practice and guiding education policy and highlight important directions for future research.

The goals of Moodog are twofold: first, to provide instructors with insight about how students interact with online course materials, and second, to allow students to easily compare their own progress to others in the class. With the activity information available, Moodog also provides automatic email reminders to students encouraging or instructing them to view available materials that they have not yet accessed. Using Moodog, we have conducted a preliminary case study on a course held in Spring 2006 at the University of California, Santa Barbara to reveal activity patterns that occurred in this course.},
